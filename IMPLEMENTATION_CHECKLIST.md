## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

#### 1. **Environment Preparation**
- [ ] Backup current application and database
- [ ] Verify PHP 8.3/8.4 compatibility on target server
- [ ] Check required PHP extensions
- [ ] Ensure proper file permissions

#### 2. **Configuration Review**
- [ ] Review `application/config/security_modern.php` settings
- [ ] Adjust rate limiting thresholds for your environment
- [ ] Configure file upload restrictions
- [ ] Set appropriate password policies
- [ ] Enable/disable features as needed

#### 3. **Database Preparation**
- [ ] The Security Monitor will auto-create the `security_events` table
- [ ] Ensure database user has CREATE TABLE permissions
- [ ] Plan for log retention and cleanup

### Deployment Process

#### Step 1: Deploy Files
```bash
# Upload modernized files to your server
# Key files to deploy:
- application/helpers/security_helper.php
- application/config/security_modern.php
- application/libraries/Modern_validation.php
- application/libraries/Security_monitor.php
- application/controllers/Security_review.php
- application/controllers/Modern_form_example.php
- Updated core files (MY_Model.php, MY_Controller.php)
- Updated controllers (Authentication.php, Home.php, etc.)
- Updated JavaScript (assets/js/custom.js)
```

#### Step 2: Load Security Helper
Add to your `application/config/autoload.php`:
```php
$autoload['helper'] = array('security');
```

#### Step 3: Enable Security Features
In your main controllers, add:
```php
public function __construct() {
    parent::__construct();
    $this->load->helper('security');
    $this->load->library('Security_monitor');
    $this->load->config('security_modern');
}
```

#### Step 4: Update Existing Forms
Replace old form handling patterns with new secure methods:
```php
// OLD
if ($_POST) {
    // process form
}

// NEW
if ($this->input->server('REQUEST_METHOD') === 'POST') {
    if (!validate_csrf_token()) {
        // handle CSRF
        return;
    }
    if (!rate_limit_check('form_action', 5, 300)) {
        // handle rate limit
        return;
    }
    // process form securely
}
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

#### 1. **Run Tests**
```bash
php simple_security_test.php
```
Expected result: All tests should pass (100% success rate)

#### 2. **Security Dashboard**
- Access `/security_review` (admin only)
- Review security status
- Check recommendations
- Verify monitoring is active

#### 3. **Test Security Features**
- [ ] Test rate limiting on login form
- [ ] Verify CSRF protection on forms
- [ ] Test file upload restrictions
- [ ] Check password policy enforcement
- [ ] Verify security event logging

#### 4. **Monitor Security Events**
- Check security events are being logged
- Verify alerts are working
- Test brute force detection
- Review security statistics

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Customization

### Rate Limiting Adjustment
Edit `application/config/security_modern.php`:
```php
$config['rate_limits'] = [
    'login' => [
        'max_attempts' => 5,        // Adjust based on your needs
        'time_window' => 900,       // 15 minutes
    ],
    'contact_form' => [
        'max_attempts' => 3,        // Adjust for your traffic
        'time_window' => 3600,      // 1 hour
    ]
];
```

### File Upload Security
```php
$config['file_upload'] = [
    'max_size' => 2097152,          // 2MB - adjust as needed
    'allowed_types' => [
        'images' => ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif'],
        'documents' => ['pdf', 'doc', 'docx']
    ]
];
```

### Password Policy
```php
$config['password_policy'] = [
    'min_length' => 8,              // Minimum password length
    'require_uppercase' => true,    // Require uppercase letters
    'require_lowercase' => true,    // Require lowercase letters
    'require_numbers' => true,      // Require numbers
    'require_special_chars' => true // Require special characters
];
```
